# name-this-release (ntr)

Do you like the way Docker name your containers? Or maybe the way AngularJS name its releases? Lucky you! This script will create a random noun / adjective pair to name your apps's releases.

There is only a spanish dictionary with abstract nouns for now, but the idea is to improve this script with more dictionaries to generate really cool names.

Check the examples below:

- culpa-social
- intuicion-mayor
- temor-popular
- afecto-acido
- gule-util
