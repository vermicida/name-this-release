# name-this-release (ntr)

Do you like the way Docker name your containers? Or maybe the way AngularJS name its releases? Lucky you! This script will create a random noun / adjective pair to name your apps's releases.

There is only a spanish dictionary with abstract nouns for now, but the idea is to improve this script with more dictionaries to generate really cool names.

Check the examples below:

- injusticia-diferente
- culpa-social
- intuicion-mayor
- temor-popular
- afecto-acido
- gula-util

## Getting started

To use this script, you must clone this repo first:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vermicida/name-this-release.git
```

Then, install the dependencies using NPM:
```bash
$ npm install
```

Another way is to download all via NPM directly:
```bash
$ npm install name-this-release
```

## Magic

Are you ready for some good magic? Then choose a card. Or run this command, what you prefer:
```bash
$ npm run ntr
```

Ok, this is not the magic you waited for. Magic only on tuesdays -I hope today isn't tuesday-.
