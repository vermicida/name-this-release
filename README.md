Do you like the way Docker name your containers? Or maybe the way AngularJS name its releases? Lucky you! This script will create a random noun / adjective pair to name your apps's releases.

There is only a spanish dictionary with abstract nouns for now, but the idea is to improve this script with more dictionaries to generate really cool names.

Check the examples below:

- injusticia-diferente
- culpa-social
- intuicion-mayor
- temor-popular
- afecto-acido
- gula-util

## Getting started

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system, so do it if you haven't.

Install `name-this-release` globally running this command from your terminal:

```bash
$ npm install name-this-release -g
```

## Magic

Are you ready for some magic? Then choose a card! Or run this command, what you do prefer:

```bash
$ ntr
```

Ok, I know this is not the magic you've been waiting for. But it's cool, isn't it?
